In Assignment #3	we need to perform following task:

a.Study about the Egg Hunter shellcode
b.Create a working demo of the Egghunter
c.Should be configurable for different payloads	

a. Study about the Egg Hunter shellcode
 
Egg Hunting: Egg hunting is a technique used to search Virtual Address Space (VAS) for pattern referred to by Egg that usually marks 
the start of our desired payload. If we hit an unallocated memory while searching for that pattern we may experience that ,the process 
will SIGSEGV leading to a crash.To prevent this kind of behavior we may abuse the system syscall to hunt for our egg without crashing.
 
The "egg-hunter" is a form of staged shellcode that is useful when we can inject a large payload into a process but aren't sure where 
in memory it will end up. If we can get the instruction pointer to point to a smaller, hunter code, 
we can search memory to find the main payload, which is prepended with a small tag of bytes (the egg).

There is a great resource for egg hunter theory/implementation at http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf.
